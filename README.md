# lumeod-balena-jetson

Base app/image that you can install lumeod on. Work in Progress.

Push to your fleet using :

`balena push <fleet-name>`

Then log into the installed app container : 

`balena ssh <device-uuid> lumeo`

and run the lumeo installer. The installer requires manual workarounds to work at the moment.
